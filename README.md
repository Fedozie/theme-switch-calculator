- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- How to create a toggle switch which toggles more than to themes.
- How to use functions in Javascript to simulate the operations of a calculator.

### Continued development

Working on this task made me realize, I still have a lot of work to do as regards my knowledge of Javascript.
